<br /><br />It's a good practice to redirect user to get requests after making some changes with post and this is<br />usually done by Spring WebFlow by default. But what if by some reason you need to use <code>&lt;webflow:always-redirect-on-pause value="false"/&gt;</code> option?<br />You can do this through java code. This approach is not described in WebFlow reference but documented via API javadoc.<br />Suppose you have some Action which is configured through WebFlow. If you want to make redirect to GET after this action you can modify action methods in following way:<br /><br /><code></code><br /><pre><code>public Event saveMyItem(RequestContext context) {<br /> //do some operations here<br /><br /> //issue redirect<br /> context.getExternalContext().requestFlowExecutionRedirect(); <br /> return success();<br />}<br /></code></pre><br />When WebFlow starts generating HTTP response it will send 302 code.<br /><br /><div><br /></div>
