Recently I needed to create a user in Oracle11g database and I was surprised that for other people following expression works well:<br /><pre><code><br />CREATE USER name IDENTIFIED BY password<br /></code></pre>But I'm constantly getting <code>ORA-00922: missing or invalid option</code> error. Quoting the password solves the problem, so following expression works fine: <br /><pre><code><br />CREATE USER name IDENTIFIED BY "password"</code></pre><br />It turned out that for password which contain only digits or start with a letter quotes aren't needed, so first expression works fine. But if the password starts with digit then quotes are required. So <code>123456</code>, <code>qwerty</code> and <code>asdf1234</code> don't need quotes, while <code>"1234qwer"</code> or <code>"2asdf"</code> should be quoted.
