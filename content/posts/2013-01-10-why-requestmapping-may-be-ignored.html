<span style="font-family: inherit;">Recently I had a problem with Spring MVC. My mappings made by @RequestMapping annotations were ignored, but I was sure that annotation processor was picking the bean correctly. It turned out that if you use org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping to do some mapping in XML then you need to include DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping explicitly into your application context:</span>  <br /><pre><code>&lt;bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping"/&gt;</code></pre><br />This is not needed when you have only annotation-based mapping - then&nbsp; <span style="font-family: inherit;">DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping is included by default. This is documented only in </span>&nbsp;JavaDoc so it may be hard to spot.
