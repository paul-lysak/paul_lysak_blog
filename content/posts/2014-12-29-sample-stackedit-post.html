<p>For a long time I was upset with lack of native support of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> in Blogger. Both manual editing of HTML and lame WYSIWYG editor are counter-productive. Recently I finally had time to search for solution - and here is almost a silver bullet: <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>. It can be used on-line or installed as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stackedit/iiooodelglhkcpgbajoejffhijaclcdg">Chrome Plugin</a>. This is the first post written with StackEdit.</p> <p>For me it worked like this - hope that by the time you read it StackEdit will be further improved and it will be a bit simpler:</p> <ol><li>Install plugin</li><li>Create folder in GoogleDocs (unfortunately not available in StackEdit itself) and set up its synchronization in StackEdit (#/Synchronize/)</li><li>Create folder for blog entries on local storage via StackEdit</li><li>Create some document in StackEdit, write its content</li><li>Unfortunately there’s no option to customize folder on document creation - so it has to be moved manually to spedific folder. Both in StackEdit and in GoogleDocs separately - unlike document content, location isn’t synchronized automatically. <br>1 Publish the document on Blogger (#/Publish/Blogger)</li><li>Go to Blogger and specify tags - unfortunately I didn’t find means to assign it directly from StackEdit</li><li>If you edit the document and want to re-publish it - #/Publish/Update publication. Nice that StackEdit remembers where you’ve published it last time</li></ol>
