Suppose you have some class MyService configured as Spring bean: <pre><code><br />@Component<br />class MyService extends MyBaseService {<br />  def myOperation() {<br />    ...<br />  }<br />}<br /></code></pre> Which is referenced somewhere in the project:  <pre><code><br />...<br />@Autowired<br />private var myService: MyService = _<br />...<br /></code></pre> So far this code works, and now you'd like to mix in some trait into your service to add common functionality:  <pre><code><br />@Component<br />class MyService extends MyBaseService with MyTrait {<br />  def myOperation() {<br />    ...<br />  }<br />}<br /></code></pre> And suddenly Spring can't find bean for autowiring. The problem is that if you use proxies for AOP functionality then Spring detects the only interface implemented by MyService - and it's MyTrait. Therefore there's no more MyService instance in application contect, there's only a proxy implementing MyTrait and forwarding calls of methods available in MyTrait to MyService instance.   Without that trait Spring used subclassing to build proxy which worked find.
