Just discovered weird behavior of Scala's protected methods: they're actually compiled to public methods in byte-code. Therefore if you try to override them in Java code with another protected method compilation will fail with something like this: <code>"attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public"</code>. After some googling I've discovered that other people <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8110799/can-i-create-a-method-with-java-protected-access-in-scala">also spotted this issue</a>. I think such weird compiler behavior was needed because of access level mismatch in Scala and Java - but I thought that Scala's <code>protected</code> is more restrictive then Java's. So I'm yet to figure out reason of such behavior. By the way, package-level protected (like <code>protected[yourpackage]</code>) is also compiled to <code>public</code> - at least for Scala 2.10.0
