<p>Recently I was trying to do some cleanup of shared DB after the tests (with ScalaTest) of Play application using <code>afterAll</code> method of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> trait. DB credentials were contained in Play’s config files so cleanup code relied on running play application. But when trying to run the test I’ve got an exception:</p> <pre><code>java.lang.RuntimeException: There is no started application<br /></code></pre> <p>Looks like application was shut down before <code>afterAll</code> gets started. Turns out that traits inclusion order matters here. Following code throws an exception:</p> <pre><code>class MySpec extends PlaySpec <br />             with OneServerPerSuite <br />             with BeforeAndAfterAll {<br />   //tests go here<br />   override def afterAll(): Unit = {<br />       //cleanup code goes here<br />   }<br />}<br /></code></pre> <p>while this works perfectly:</p> <pre><code>class MySpec extends PlaySpec<br />             with BeforeAndAfterAll <br />             with OneServerPerSuite ...<br /></code></pre> <p>Same applies to <code>OneAppPerSuite</code>. The reason is order of overriding <code>SuiteMixin.run()</code> method. <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> attaches there handling of <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> methods, and <code>OneServerPerSuite</code> attaches <code>testServer.start()</code> and <code>testServer.stop()</code>. Didn’t check it, but appears that due to this ordering only one of <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> can have access to Play application. So, now <code>beforeAll</code> will fail to access application configs.</p>
